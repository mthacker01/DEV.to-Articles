# Hello World!
This is my first post to Dev.to, as well as my first technology related post ever üëè.

If we're being honest, I've always been apprehensive about creating blog posts because I was worried that would just showcase __*just how much*__ I really didn't know. I've spent the last 6 years picking up and dropping learning to code because I constantly felt like I would never get it. But with this go around, I decided that in additional to just learning the literal how-to of coding, I would be more engaged with the dev community as a means to hold myself more accountable. Even though it sometimes feels like speaking into a vast, populated void where literally no one knows who I am or could care less about my desire to learn programming, it holds me accountable.


## #100DaysOfCode
The #100DaysOfCoding Challenge is one of the best examples of this. This is challenge has been my "toe in the water" into the dev community and I could not be more excited. What I originally thought was going to be a noisy void of people who don't care, is actually a welcoming community full of people just like me, starting their own journey, and people who have been in this field for years willing to share their knowledge. 

I only wish I had taken this approach in my previous attempts at learning to code because I can only image how far along I would be now, instead of getting frustrated and giving up. Everyday, I know a little bit more than I did the day before and that's what matters.

### __"So, if you don't know anything, what's with the blog?"__

I decided to start committing  (git commit -m "here's why") my thoughts to Dev.to for two reasons:
1.  As a way to explain concepts to myself that I'm struggling with. If I can write it down in my own words, it will help me retain it.
2.  As my contribution to be a part of the community that has already helped me so much. For anyone who comes along later and reaches a point they want to give up.

Honestly, I have no idea if anyone will ever see this but it's not the point. At some point down the road, I'll find this again and remember I had to start somewhere and hopefully I can help others find their somewhere.
