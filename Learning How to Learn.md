# Learning How to Learn to Code!
## <em>Yes, you read that correctly...</em>
***
Earlier this week, I published my first [article](https://dev.to/mthacker09/my-first-commit-b7g) to Dev.to about how I began my journey into programming. In that article, I mentioned that I had picked up and given up coding several times over the course of several years. I <strong><em> hate</em></strong> thinking about how far along I'd be right now had I just kept with it...so I try not focusing on that üë®üèª‚Äçüíª. 

I've decided that I want to utilize my Dev.to account to create articles and tutorials aimed at people that learn im similar ways that I do. 

#### What is this for??
The main obstacle I ran into during my first attempts at coding is that I could learn the material, but the courses I went through never given a reason <em>WHY</em> or <em>HOW</em> whatever it was that I was learning was applicable to my long-term goal of being a developer. Yes, I could understand what an array is, what an object is, and what a function is. I understood the technical definitions of each, but how was it applicaple to my goals? What piece does it play in the final picture? 

Over the course of my professional career, I grown adept to understanding how I learn best; and that method is by deconstructing. I learn better when I see the end result, and I break that into smaller parts, and learn how those parts work together. I continue that process until I'm down to the very basics. I will say that this process isn't the <em>exact</em> process I follow every time but it does give a general idea of my learning style.

I want to utilize this blog as a means create tutorials for those learners that need the bigger picture; to learn, not just the how, but the why. 

Hopefully others will get something out of this as well! 

#### Happy Coding!
